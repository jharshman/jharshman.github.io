I'm Josh Harshman â€” Principal Architect and Engineering Manager at Bitly. I work on infrastructure, systems, and tooling that teams depend on every day.

My background is in platform engineering and distributed systems. I write a lot of Go, spend most of my time in Linux, and care about reliability, observability, and operational clarity.
